During this project my goal was to scrape the entire list of UF salaries that I found on Google. Then transferred the data from powershell to a text file. I used microsoft excel's txt to xslx feature and sucessufully transported the data from the college of liberal arts and sciences like I intended. Once the data was there I cleaned it up and assigned the information to variables by columns.

I found highcharts graphs that I wanted to use but could not figure out how to parse through the data to get the sum, average, etc. That I would need to retrieve the data how I had originally planned. Also, I ran into flask issues because of confusion between trying to make the tutorial work specifically for my project.
